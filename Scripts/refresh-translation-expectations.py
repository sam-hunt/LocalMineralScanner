# LocalMineralScanner's config shim over the shared sidecar-refresh engine
# (l10n/refresh/refresh_expectations.py — the rimworld-l10n submodule),
# which drives the L10nProbe dev mod (source at l10n/probe/; build/deploy it
# only from the canonical ~/dev/rimworld-l10n checkout). The engine holds all
# logic; this file holds only this repo's config and the rationale behind it.
# Usage is unchanged (game must be closed):
#   python3 Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py [--no-launch]
# If l10n/ is empty, run: git submodule update --init

# MayRequire (no compat load roots in LoadFolders.xml), and it uses no
# Harmony, so per the engine's membership rule nothing else belongs on the
# list — an extra mod adds no keys of its own but its patches to our defs
# would leak into the expectations. It has no family siblings sharing a
# boot list either. See the engine's header for the membership rule, the
# lowercase-id warning, and the pinning rationale; order is load order,
# the probe last.
